## üåü Project Overview
**Automated Network Request Management in ServiceNow** is a streamlined solution that **automates network-related service requests** through a **user-friendly self-service portal**.  

The system leverages **ServiceNow workflows, service catalog items, approval processes, and Flow Designer automation** to ensure requests are captured, validated, and routed efficiently. Upon submission, requests trigger **automated notifications, task assignments, and optional integration with network automation tools**, reducing manual intervention and improving SLA adherence.

- **Custom Service Catalog:** Predefined catalog items for common network requests.  
- **Dynamic Forms:** Capture relevant details using variables, variable sets, and UI policies.  
- **Automated Approval Workflows:** Multi-level approvals based on request type and sensitivity.  
- **Integration with Automation Tools (Optional):** Fulfill standard requests without manual intervention.  
- **Real-Time Status Updates & Notifications:** Keep requesters and technicians informed.
